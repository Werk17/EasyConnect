DESCRIPTION OF PROJECT:

	Our project will be on the bases of connecting two or more different users to each other through a chat platform on the web application. The web application is specific to the client and will only allow end-users that are within the organization. The importance of this application is on the bases of security and simplicity. When two people are connecting through email with no prior relationship; it can be hard to determine if any one specific email is legitimate. This platform would alleviate the stress and user prone errors when determining if an email is indeed fraudulent. It will also allow for faster connection between two people, and specific organized parties between users of the organization.
	A user that is trying to login to the web application will be asked to create a new account. They won’t be able to create a new account without a specific key that is set by the organization. This will prevent any users that aren’t allowed on the web application. Along with their email, password, name, and org. key; they will also be asked to provide their specific area or work, along with their availability. Once a user has logged in, they will be directed to the web applications chat page. 
	On this chat page will be a list of options that allow the user to select who they want to be chatting with. This can be IT help, HR help, Payroll help, Security help, General help, Permission help. Once this is selected, the user will be thrown into a group chat of all available help within the organization. This will allow them to get help fast and connect with people safely.
